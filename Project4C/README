Resources used:

TA slides from all discussions (1B, 1C, and 1E) were of great help and
some of the more obscure API were made very clear because of
the slides.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1516766/how-to-get-a-file-stream-from-a-file-descriptor

- this resource taught me that there was a c standard library function that lets a file descriptor be
treated as a file stream
- this helped me easily use fgets instead of reimplimenting another input parsing function
